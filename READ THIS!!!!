Need Gearinfo addon from https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo for any of these to work.  
Certain codes needed for gearinfo are in the global files you have to copy and paste them into your actual luas or globals, depending how you want to approach this.  I suggest just copy pasting the section from my globals into yours if you want to use these.  
Motes-TH thing is also in the globals, it will be needed for the TH toggle function to work.
