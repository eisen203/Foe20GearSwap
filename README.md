Need Gearinfo addon from https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo for any of these to work.
Certain codes needed for gearinfo are in the global files, I would atleast look at them.
For certain people it might be best to just copy paste them over, I have keybinds in the globals too so look at those also.
